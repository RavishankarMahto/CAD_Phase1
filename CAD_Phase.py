# Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

# Define your predictive use case and dataset (e.g., using randomly generated data)
use_case = "Predict Customer Churn"

# Generate random data for demonstration
np.random.seed(0)
n_samples = 1000
n_features = 5

X = np.random.rand(n_samples, n_features)
y = np.random.randint(2, size=n_samples)

# Phase 2: Data Preprocessing and Model Training

# Preprocess the data (e.g., scale features)
# Split the data into training and testing sets
# Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Phase 3: Model Deployment

# Create a Flask web application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define an endpoint for making predictions
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get input data from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    features = data['features']
    
    # Perform any necessary preprocessing on the input data
    features = scaler.transform([features])
    
    # Make predictions using the trained model
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    # Return the prediction as JSON response
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

# Phase 4: Integration

# In your application, make API requests to the '/predict' endpoint to get real-time predictions
# You can use libraries like 'requests' in Python to make API requests

# Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

# Document your project, including its objective, design thinking process, and development phases
# Share your code on a GitHub repository with detailed instructions on how to deploy and use the model
